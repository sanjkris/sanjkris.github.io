Assignment 1: This was a very simple assignment, in which I merely had to set up a Github account and connect it to Cloud9. I also had to create a repository and take a questionnaire about myself. This assignment was very easy because it was the first assignment that we had to do in class.

Assignment 2: This assignment was more complicated. I had to combine all of the Github code that I had learned in order to create a website. It was confusing at first because I have little to no programming experience, but I soon got the hang of it. It has become rather fun to figure out how to tweak the code to see real changes on my website.
