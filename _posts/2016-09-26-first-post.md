The first few days of class, I was extremely confused about how to go about using Github and Cloud 9. I felt that the demonstrations went by way too fast, so I had difficulty keeping up with what was happening. As time went by, however, I was able to understand what was going on more fully, and I feel that I comprehend how to use the systems that we have been learning. I feel much more confident about completing Assignment 2.

It is actually very interesting to learn about new ways of formatting and coding my website. The more I learn, the more I am excited about this class.
