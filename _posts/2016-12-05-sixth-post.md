This was definitely the most work-intensive assignment that we have had in this class, which makes sense since it is the final assignment. Working with a partner made the journey a lot easier.

Christiana suggested that we do the topic of informational retrieval, which she definitely knew more about than me, but I enjoyed learning about it as we worked on the assignment. We pulled important information from different sources, and she put them together on the slides. I chose and put in the pictures for the slides. We also met up over the weekend and recorded our parts for the presentation.

Trying to get the right format for the presentation definitely took a lot of trial and error. We had trouble trying to incorporate the video into the presentation. We also did not know how to get the pictures to show up at first. It also took a while to get used to the markdown. We were able to work through these issues together and with the help of Professor Hauser. I also could not figure out how to get the presentation to show up on my Github site, so Professor Hauser suggested that I just link to Christianaâ€™s.

Some lightbulbs that came on during this assignment include how to better use markdown. I had learned markdown before, but I really learned how to utilize it for this assignment in a way that I understood. Adding different colors and styles to each slide was also fun once I understood the process of how to do that.

A little something from each previous assignment was incorporated into this assignment. Pandoc, markdown, and incorporating images and videos were all useful. I also used the skill of learning how to work at something using trial and error during this assignment that I have learned from previous assignments.

Overall, it was fun to use skills that I have learned before on this final assignment. The coding I learned in this class, especially markdown, should be useful in the future. The skills that I learned will definitely be put on my resume and will hopefully help my chances in getting a job. The assignments in this class also halped me to keep trying at something until I get it right because there were not a lot of step-by-step instructions to follow.
