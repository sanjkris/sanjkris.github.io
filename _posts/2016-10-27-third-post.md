My piece of written work that I converted from markdown to the different file types is an essay that I wrote for my Policy 340 class, Justice in Public Policy. As a Public Policy major, this is one of the classes that I had to take to fulfill my major requirements. We had to look at a case study of a real life event and apply theories of justice that we had learned throughout the semester to the event. I chose the rape of Trisha Meili and the case of the Central Park 5, who were five black and Hispanic men who were wrongly accused of raping a white jogger in New York City. This case is important because it emphasizes the biases of the justice system in the United States.

In order to get my written work into multiple formats, I first converted the docx file that I uploaded to the workspace to markdown using the pandoc -o command. I proceeded to edit the essay in markdown, and then used the same command to convert the file to the four required document types.

The files that I converted to were markdown, docx, odt, pdf, and html.

Challenges:

I had some challenges while completing this assignment. One was that I was not quite sure how to implement some of the markdown requirements. It took me a while to figure out how to correctly format the table. I also did not even know what smart quotes were at first, and I had to google them. It was a satisfying feeling once I figured these out, however. I have found that in this class, it may take me a while to figure something out, but once I do, it feels really good - work hard and get rewarded.
