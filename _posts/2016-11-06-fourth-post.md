This assignment was much easier than the previous two assignments. The amount of work that needed to be completed was much less, and it was also very helpful to be able to work with two other people. I am sometimes wary of group projects because you never know how your group members will end up being, but this group assignemnt worked out well.

To start with, we had trouble pulling the files to our individual repositories at first. We had to figure out and tweak some things before everyone got the necessary files into their repository. We created the five questions together, and it was pretty easy to put them into a script, since we had learned much more complicated ways to write scripts for the previous assignment. I was the one who incorporated the questions into the original script using variable names. Creating the datestamp and a unique identifier was more complicated because I had personally never done that before. My group members, however, did have experience with this, and we were able to work together to get this done. Again, working in a group was very helpful for me because it is useful to be able to collaborate with other people in order to complete an assignment.

This task of creating a dataset was the easiest assignment I have had so far other than the first assignment, but I think I learned a lot about how to create and organize data.
