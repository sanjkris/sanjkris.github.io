For my first tech event, I went to a 3D printing workshop, which was interesting because I have not had any experience with that before. I did not realize how much access we as students have to 3D printing and other advanced technology. I always read about things like that in articles online, but I never thought about doing it myself. Of course, you have to send in a 3D printing request, in which you have to specify what you want to print, why you want to print it, and the sizing. I researched some articles about 3D printing beforehand, and some of the things that I learned that you can print included dinosaur bones, a bust of Yoda, your face in chocolate, and a customized iPhone case. These all seemed very random but also very interesting.

I learned a lot about the specifics of 3D printing. Unlike a 2D printer, a 3D one prints an object in layers. Basically, if you can draw and design something, you are able to print it in 3D. This seems daunting to someone like me, who is terrible at drawing and design. The time that it takes to print something in 3D apparently can take anywhere from hours to days. I was not aware of this large range.

3D printing can be used as lot more than just a cool way of designing objects. I imagine that professionals in the medical, engineering, or other important fields can use this tool to their advantage. Something like this could be used to improve people's quality of life, and that is why I think it is so important.

Personally, I would love to learn about 3D printing more extensively. Some things that it would be cool to design and print are clothes. I learned that some places are even designing how to print food, which would help so many people.

Overall, I had a great experience!
