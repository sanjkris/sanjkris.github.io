For assignment 5, we worked with the same groups that we had for assignment 4. I think that I would have had a very hard time with this assignment if it hadn't been for my group members because it was actually quite challenging to figure out how to complete all of the requirements. In previous assignments, there was a clear step-by-step process as far as how to go about completing all of the requirements, but here we had to do some googling around and critical thinking to try and figure it out. We especially had trouble with how to incorporate the password into our script, but we eventually decided to just leave the password blank. We also had trouble loading the csv file into mysql, but we figured out how to do that too.

Our script asks the user five questions about him or herself, assigns the user's data a date and unique identifier, loads the data into a csv file, adds it to a database in mysql, and dumps it to a sql file.

Overall, I learned a lot about mysql and databases from completing this assignment.
