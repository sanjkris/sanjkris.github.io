For my second event, I participated in an experiential education showcase for my public policy senior capstone course. As a public policy major, this is the last required course that I have to take. My team of four spent the semester working on a project for the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. The OCRCC wanted us to design and administer surveys to high school students in CHCSS schools to find out how much they know about Title IX policies and procedures. Data found from these surveys would then be used to bolster activists and to convince the school board to invest more money into Title IX education.

This may seem like a project that does not involve much tech, but I was surprised by just how much technology we used. After obtaining the survey results, we used qualtrics and the data analysis software Stata in order to analyze the results. We were then able to utilize this analyzed data and create engaging graphics to show trends in Title IX knowledge among high school students across race and gender lines. The results were unfortunately not that surprising: high school students had very little knowledge of Title IX policies and procedures, were not sure about the definition of consent, and were uncomfortable reporting sexual harassment or assault to administrators. These findings would not have been possible without the technology that we used.

At the experiential education showcase, my team and I were able to display our results and our recommendations for the future to people who came to the showcase. Everyone was shocked by the results and agreed that further action needs to be taken in order to teach high school students about Title IX.

While doing this project, I learned that public policy can be combined with tech in order to enact social change. It was cool to see how different aspects of the classes I am taking in different majors can be used together to create a final project. The OCRCC let us know that they are going to use our analyzed data to present to the school board and other organizations. They even asked us to present the data to these groups. It is exciting that a semester long project for a class may be continued in the future and create changes in the real world.
